### Welcome to my world 👋
Between web, ergonomics and communication. At work, I merge my creativity with my computer skills.


## I am

### EMPATHETIC 🙂
Understanding people should be considered like a superpower.

### INTUITIVE 💡
Very useful to predict the ending of films, solving puzzles and avoiding lousy projects.

### SMILING 😁
If you had work with toxic colleagues. You will be sensitive to it.
This is my default mode. Even when I'm uncomfortable, I smile too!

### TEAM SPIRIT 🙋🏻‍♀️
Alone we go faster, together we go further! Make a task out of my process line to releive the team. Help a colleague on a blocking point... Stand together without unnecessarily pointing out someone in charge. This is my state of mind.

### RESOURCEFUL 🧩
My mind loves to solve any problem. And my way of thinking is different. Each problem could be solve, we can always find a solution!
In the sense: skillful, ingenious.

I'm not just a geek 😝
## I need

### BOXING 🥊
For over ten years, boxing has allowed me to clear my head and feel better about myself. 💪🏻

### SINGING 🎵
Passion liberating emotion. I have dared to sing outside my bathroom for three years.
It’s liberating and rewarding.

### HIKING, OR HUGGING A TREE 🌳
Simple, outdoor outings recharge my batteries. Sneakers, hiking shoes, skating shoes or skis on my feet, I enjoy walking and it’s part of my balance. I'm lucky, the region (Auvergne Rhone Alpes) is made for it!

## I do
